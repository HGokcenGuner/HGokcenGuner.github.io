Iâ€™m a third year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Prof. Kaushik Dayal (CIT/CEE)](https://sites.google.com/view/kaushik-dayal-research-group/home) and [Prof. Alexandra Ion (SCS/HCII)](https://alexandraion.com/). I received a BS in Civil Engineering at Izmir Institute of Technology, Turkey.
